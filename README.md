## Project Overview
PetMind is a retailer of products for pets. They are based in the United States. PetMind sells products that are a mix of luxury items and everyday items. Luxury items include toys. Everyday items include food. The company wants to increase sales by selling more products for some animals repeatedly. They have been testing this approach for the last year. They now want a report on how repeat purchases impact sales.

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze and derive insights from a dataset related to pet supplies sold by an e-commerce platform. The analysis focuses on understanding sales performance, customer preferences, and product characteristics to inform strategic business decisions.

### Dataset Description:
    Size: 1500 records
    Columns:
    product_id: Unique identifier for each product.
    category: Category of the pet supply product (e.g., Equipment, Food, Toys).
    animal: Type of animal the product is intended for (e.g., Cat, Dog, Fish).
    size: Size category of the product (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).
    price: Price of the product.
    sales: Total sales quantity of the product.
    rating: Customer rating of the product (scale from 1 to 9).
    repeat_purchase: Binary indicator (0 or 1) indicating if the product was purchased more than once.

### Project Tasks:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
4. Insights and Recommendations
5. Drawing conclusions based on EDA findings
6. Visualization and Reporting


## Conclusion:
1. Sales: The average sales per product are approximately 996.60 units, with a wide range from 286.94 units to 2255.96 units. The distribution shows a median (50th percentile) of around 1000.83 units, indicating a fairly balanced distribution of sales across products.

2. Rating: The average product rating is approximately 4.99 out of 9, with ratings ranging from 1 to 9. The majority of ratings fall between 4 and 6, as indicated by the 25th percentile (Q1) and 75th percentile (Q3).

3. Repeat Purchase: About 60.4% of products have been purchased more than once, suggesting a moderate level of customer loyalty or satisfaction.

4. Category Distribution:

5. The most common categories are 'Equipment', 'Food', and 'Toys', with 'Equipment' having the highest count at 370 products.
'Unknown' category has the lowest count, indicating potential data inconsistencies or missing information.
Animal Distribution:

6. Cats ('Cat') are the most frequently represented animal, followed closely by Fish ('Fish') and Dogs ('Dog').
Birds ('Bird') have the lowest representation among the animal categories.
Size Distribution:

Most products are categorized as 'Small', with 'Medium' and 'Large' sizes also represented but to a lesser extent.

## Recommendation:
1. Enhance Product Ratings: Encourage customers to provide more ratings to improve data completeness. This can be incentivized through customer engagement strategies or feedback initiatives.

2. Category Focus: Given the high count in 'Equipment', 'Food', and 'Toys', consider allocating resources and marketing efforts towards these categories to capitalize on existing popularity.

3. Diversification in Animal and Size Categories: While Cats, Fish, and Dogs dominate, consider expanding product offerings or promotions for less represented categories like Birds to broaden customer appeal.

4. Customer Retention Strategies: With a significant portion of products being repurchased, focus on enhancing customer retention through loyalty programs, personalized offers, or improved product quality and service.

5. Data Integrity: Address any discrepancies in the 'Unknown' category to ensure accurate reporting and analysis. This may involve reviewing data entry processes or investigating reasons for missing category information.
